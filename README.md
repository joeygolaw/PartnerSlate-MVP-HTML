# PartnerSlate-MVP-HTML
---
Downloaded HTML webpages from live PartnerSlate MVP website, to be used for initial CSS/JS revisions. Pages are not linked correctly, but major assets (CSS/JS/IMG) have been redirected and consolidated.

*SASS files should be integrated in next iteration of PartnerSlate MVP to avoid the extra step of having to download static public HTML pages generated by the app.*
